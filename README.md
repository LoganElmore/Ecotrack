# Ecotrack
 Task management and data tracking application for Mobile Dev Spring 2023.

# Description
EcoTrack is a mobile app that helps users track their daily activities and their environmental impact. The app allows users to log activities, view their impact on the environment, and receive suggestions to reduce their carbon footprint.

Similar to the task management application exercise that we designed in our Mobile Development Course, this application varies by adding additional statistics on where your everyday activities or tasks can simulate the impact your daily habits (or one-off tasks) can have on the environment, and create more conscious trends by showing your data converted into an estimated carbon footprint. Some examples of data tracked are the following:

Electricity usage from electronics throughout your home or workplace
Fuel consumption based on machinery being operated and mileage
Food waste/consumption
Etc.
